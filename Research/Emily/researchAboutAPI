frevvo database can save the data
A SQL query may return a single row or multiple rows, each with many columns. Thanks to the Database Connector, the form will automatically update to show you the information relevant to your request – in an easily readable format.
In reverse, the DB Connector will “translate” data from JSON or XML to SQL to keep the database happy.
Less data entry (and more productivity)
Fewer errors and omissions 
Automated connection pooling, retries, etc.
Protection against SQL injections and other attacks 
Complex queries such as SQL joins
Encrypted connections for higher security
Rapid implementation with minimal coding

Web Storage makes it possible to easily store arbitrary values in the browser. Storage is different from cookies in that it’s not shared with the server.
key – the property name of the value stored
newValue – the newly set value (duh!)
oldValue – the previous value before being overwritten by .newValue
url – the full url path of the origin of the storage event
storageArea – the storage object, either localStorage or sessionStorage
