//Session Saving
https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_webstorage.asp
--> data that is stored (and then reset) every time a page is used, as opposed to local storage which is data that stored indefinitely (eg #reps done in a single workout vs a workout routine?)

//from https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/sessionStorage

Usage of session save:
// Save data to sessionStorage
sessionStorage.setItem("key", "value");

// Get saved data from sessionStorage
let data = sessionStorage.getItem("key");

// Remove saved data from sessionStorage
sessionStorage.removeItem("key");

// Remove all saved data from sessionStorage
sessionStorage.clear();

Could maybe implement something similar for our workout drag & drop? Eg if you're working on making a workout but then accidentally reload the page, you don't have to restart
// Get the text field that we're going to track
let field = document.getElementById("field");

// See if we have an autosave value
// (this will only happen if the page is accidentally refreshed)
if (sessionStorage.getItem("autosave")) {
  // Restore the contents of the text field
  field.value = sessionStorage.getItem("autosave");
}

// Listen for changes in the text field
field.addEventListener("change", () => {
  // And save the results into the session storage object
  sessionStorage.setItem("autosave", field.value);
});
